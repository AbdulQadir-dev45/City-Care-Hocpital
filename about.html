      <h2>Welcome to City Care Hospital!</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Every day thousands of people enter the gates of City Care Hospital (CCH) seeking medical attention for themselves or their loved ones. With an undying commitment to excellence that meets international standards, regulations and quality systems, we make sure that the patient’s needs are met satisfactorily under a single roof. City Care Hospital is located in the center of the bustling city of Karachi near the National Cricket Stadium. Owing to this unique location CCH has easy access from all quadrants of the city.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        CCH was conceived in 1950 by Syed Wajid Ali Shah and his associates and officially inaugurated in 1958 as a not-for-profit organization with a vision to provide quality healthcare at an affordable cost to all socioeconomic classes. Over the years, the hospital has evolved to become the largest tertiary care hospital in the country with more than 700 beds. We also have the largest number of ICU beds and ventilators in the city. The hospital excels in all facets of medicine, surgery, diagnostics and medical support services. CCH houses more than 35 specialties. Considering patient’s care as priority, we provide 24 hour emergency services, acute care, inpatient, outpatient and day care facilities not only to the city but also to patients from the far reaching corners of Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.
